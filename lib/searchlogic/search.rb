module Searchlogic
  # A class that acts like a model, creates attr_accessors for scopes, and then
  # chains together everything when an "action" method is called. It basically makes
  # implementing search forms in your application effortless:
  #
  #   search = User.search
  #   search.username_like = "bjohnson"
  #   search.all
  #
  # Is equivalent to:
  #
  #   User.search(:username_like => "bjohnson").all
  #
  # Is equivalent to:
  #
  #   User.username_like("bjohnson").all
